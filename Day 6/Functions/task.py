#functions - a component of code, which has some functionalities.

#defining function - def my_function():
#calling function - my_function()

print("Hello")
num_clear = len("Hello")
print(num_clear)

#Own Function - we need a keyword called "def"
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye") #this result nothing bcoz we haven't executed it yet.

my_function() #Now, the code will run.

#NOTE: for more practice on functions had to Reeborg's World!
